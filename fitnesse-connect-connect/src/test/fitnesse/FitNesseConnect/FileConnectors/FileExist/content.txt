!2 File exists - Fixture documentation and tests
!4 Purpose
The purpose of this fixture is to be able to verify if one or more files, exist at the given path. In the first row you have to specify the resource path. The 'protocoll' part of the resource path specification determines how the connector tries to access the files. You have to following options:
 * classpath: - the file is searched in the !-FitNesse-! classpath
 * http: - the connector looks for the files thru HTTP protocol
 * file: - the connector looks for the files in the file system
The fixture comes in two flavours:
 * [[single file check][^SingleFileCheck]]
 * [[files in folder checked][^DirectoryCheck]]
