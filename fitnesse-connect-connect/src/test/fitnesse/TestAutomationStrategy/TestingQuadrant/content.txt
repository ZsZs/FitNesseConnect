 * '''automated or manual''',
 * '''which stakeholders it supports''', the development team, architects, business analysts or product developers, 
 * '''who specifies, performs''', developer, tester or user
 * '''scope of the test''', whether a unit, a layer, an integrated system, application or whole application landscape is tested,
 * '''if it evaluates the fulfilment of requirement''', whether the test is part of a contract or acceptance criteria.
